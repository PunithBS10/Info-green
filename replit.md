# Overview

This is a Global Renewable Electricity Dashboard that visualizes renewable electricity data from Our World in Data (OWID). The application provides interactive maps, country analytics, and comprehensive global renewable energy statistics through a modern web interface. Users can explore renewable electricity shares by country, view global trends, and analyze regional performance with interactive visualizations.
